                                SOP - Leave Request

                                An employee needs to create a leave request through KSPS’ request section at least one hour prior to the office start time in order for the respective day to be considered as informed leave.

                                It is recommended that the leave request is generated at least one day before and an employee should wait for the approval of their leave request unless there is an emergency case.

                                In case of planned leaves exceeding 10 days, employees must wait for the approval of their Project Manager who will reach a consensus after having a discussion with higher management.



                                SOP - Late Arrivals

                                Strict measures will be taken against late arrivals. You are advised to read and follow the below mentioned points carefully:

                                Please make sure that you reach the office on time.

                                Relaxation in terms of penalty will only be provided in case of two late arrivals, after that, you will be liable for the penalties.

                                Requests for late day removal will also not be entertained at all, even for a genuine reason.

                                Exceptions will be made for scenarios, where you have special orders from the company itself.



                                SOP - Presentation

                                After selecting a topic and making presentation, you will email the topic to HR with Date/time, Presentation Slides and Participants/Audience names.

                                HR will then send calendar invite on your behalf to the participants and will make sure that all the arrangements are complete by coordinating with Admin Department.

                                HR will double-check everything one day before the presentation and confirm it with Presenter.

                                After the presentation, a feedback form will be shared with participants, and its results will be shared with Directors.



                                SOP - Document Creation And Sharing

                                Every single report should be prepared using Google Docs and placed in the relevant project folder. If you're working on a project named "ABC eCommerce". There should be a folder on your drive named ABC eCommerce. If there's no folder then ask your project manager to share folder with you.

                                Every single project manager should request director to create a folder of the project(s) they are overseeing on Google Drive.

                                If you're making any document like features estimation, QA report, workflow doc etc, it should be uploaded or created in same relevant folder.

                                Project managers should make sure that at least a copy of all docs is in relevant folder.

                                If a project hasn't started and you're making estimation even then create a folder of the project and put it in the drive.

                                Project manager should give "share access" to different team members according to the role. For instance, if you're putting credentials in folder, just give access to the one needs them. Otherwise keep access to yourself.

                                On PM tool, share doc URL. Fortunately, you can set the permission of docs as per your wish. To all or to specific persons etc.

                                All documents that we prepare in MS office can easily be converted to Google docs.

                                If someone doesn't know how to use Google docs, please ask them to consult their Project Managers.

                                Add an SOP in directors' SOPs that they need to create folders and share with project manager as soon as project starts.
